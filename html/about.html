        <h1 id="cont-4-item-1">About</h1>
        <p id="cont-4-item-2">Hi, I’m Manu Chaitanya. I'm a multi-talented human with only 1 year of experiences in wide range of development. </p>

        <p id="cont-4-item-3">You can also call me a front-end developer, experience designer, a person having deep command in HTML, CSS, Java and its Obejct Oriented Programming and 
            any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 1/2 years of
            experiences in wide range of development disciplines, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music
            enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.  These days I am gripping the best of Data Structures, digging deep into the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.  I have also defined myself in the field of Mathematics and Physics apart from digital world.           <br><br>

            I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be
            taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting
            things that matter.

            <br><br>
            Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow
            my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural
            ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost
            impulsive need to act on them.

            My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic
            endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with
            relative ease.
